# Pokédex

This is my version of the TrueCoders Pokédex project. It is intended as a display of our mastery of React, React-Router, and APIs.

## Technologies used

I used TypeScript, React, React-Router, react context API, Tailwindcss and Material Tailwind to build this app.

## Functionality

The user is greeted with a list of the original 151 Pokémon which they can filter by name, type and weaknesses. The user can then click on a Pokémon on the list and view more details about that Pokémon, including checking the details of each of that Pokémon's evolutions.
